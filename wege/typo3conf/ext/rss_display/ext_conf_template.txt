# cat=basic//; type=options[USER_INT,USER]; label= Caching behaviour: Decide whether to handle the cache by the plugin or by the global cache preferences. If set to USER_INT the default cache duration is 3600 seconds and can be changed by TS. If set to USER the cache is as long as the cache page is configured. Do clear TYPO3 cache when changing this value!!
