Editing posts
=======================


.. _editingposts:


Users have a limited possibility to edit their own posts. A user can edit his/her post, until nobody replied to this post. If you edit a post, you will see the same form you see when you create a new post.

Moderators and administrators have the authorization to edit all users' posts at all times, even if they have already been answered.
