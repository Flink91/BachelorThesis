Private Messaging System
---------------------
The typo3_forum extension has got its own private messaging system and you can insert it as a regular page content. In order to do this you must insert the Plugin typo3_forum :: Private Messages on your selectedpage. After this you can go to the frontend and you are now ready to use the private messaging system. In this system you have the following opportunities:
•	Read private messages: Of course, you can read private messages that other users have sent to you. You will see the message's sender and the message text.
•	Write new messages/Reply to messages: You can write new messages to other users or reply to messages that other users have sent to you. A pop up search window that updates itself in real-time will help you to find your message's recipient.
•	Move messages to archive/Delete private messages: To keep your inbox clearly arranged, you can delete messages. If you do not want to delete messages, although they are not current anymore, you can move them into an archive directory.
In order to read a PM you must click on the message you want to read. Now you have the opportunity to answer the message or delete the message. If you want to answer, click on the button “reply”. Then you will get a input form with prefilled input fields. It is the same input form as the new PM form. If you want to change the recipient, click on the button “Search” and you will get a list with all registered users. Now you can click on the user you want to send the PM. If you know the recipients name you can input it in the input field directly. With an AJAX function you will get a recommended list where you can select the requested user name (it is required that you have Java Script enabled for this).
